      <div class="about-description">
        <p>I am a graduate software engineer who biggest interests lie in backend development. I enjoy my work and have been coding since my early teens, building my first application in Python 3. My proclivity towards the field of software development
          lead me to study Computer Science as a undergrad at the University of Southampton, a top 15 university for the study of Computer Science. <br><br>Since completing my undergrad, I am now equipped with a well-rounded toolset of many different languages
          and a solid understanding of many design paradigms and approaches that make tackling even the biggest problems with ease.

        <p>Most days, youâ€™ll find me fine-tuning my home server - a headless Debian machine running a series of self-hosted services, from private cloud storage to home streaming hosting a plethora of films and shows, all containerised with Docker.
        <br><br>My other hobbies include reading the works of philospohical authors such as Deleuze and Zizek just to name a few. Other interests include playing guitar and painting.</p>
